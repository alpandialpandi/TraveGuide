The Indonesian tourism industry has a lot of potential, as we know Indonesia has a very beautiful landscape. Currently, the Indonesian government is preparing 10 destinations to create a "new Bali". The Indonesian government itself targets 8.5 million foreign tourists and 1.4 billion domestic tourists in 2023. Previously, in 2022, based on data from BPS, the number of foreign tourists reached 5.47 million and domestic tourists reached 734.86 million. This must also be balanced with the number of tour guides in several destination points. Based on this information, here are some research questions for our project:
How can we increase the tour guide profession in Indonesia?
How can we make tourists interested in tourist destinations?
How can tourists get trustworthy tour guides at affordable prices?
How can tour guides get more customers?
Our team wants to tackle this problem because we want to help local tour guides get more customers and improve the tourism industry in Indonesia.

Our team identified the potential of Indonesia's tourism industry, with its beautiful landscapes and the government's plan to create a "new Bali" by developing 10 destinations. However, we noticed a challenge in the shortage of tour guides in several destinations. To address this issue, our team conducted research to determine how to increase the number of tour guides, attract more tourists, provide reliable and affordable tour guides, and help them gain more customers. We aim to improve the tourism industry in Indonesia by assisting local tour guides in attracting more customers, inspiring us to create this project.
